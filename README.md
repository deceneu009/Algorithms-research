Program used for analyzing Quicksort, Merge sort, Selection sort, Insertion sort, Bubble sort in different scenarios:

1) Arrays that contain random generated numbers
2) Arrays that are reversed
3) Arrays that are almost sorted

and in different sizes(from 10 - 100000000...and 1 billion just for fun and giggles, but I do not provide results for this one)

The program ran on the next specs:

Recommended operating systems: Linux and Windows

CPU: Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-9750H CPU @ 2.60GHz

RAM: 16 Gb 2400 mHz

Type of Memory (RAM): DDR4 SDRAM

Storage Type: SSD

In case you want to test the biggest size(1 billion numbers) you will need to have more than 8 gb of ram.If you don't have that many ram you can go inside the filegenerators folder and comment in each cpp file the lines that 
contain the size9 using "//".

For using the plot.py program you will need matplotlib module.You can find informations for installing the module here: https://matplotlib.org/stable/users/installing/index.html .

Free storage needed: 32 gb(if you chose to generate the 1 billion elements files). Otherwise, it will be around 3 gb.

Instructions:

1) Generate the files
2) Build the executable for test.cpp(examples in compiling.txt)
3) Run the exectuable

If you want to plot it you will need to have different files for each plotting option.Check which files are required for what you want to plot.
